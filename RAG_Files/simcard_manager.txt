Let’s see what preemptive measures you can take to protect your SIM card(s).
How to keep your SIM cards safe?

The following pointers can help you to keep your SIM cards safe and secure:

            Use a strong PIN
            Keep SIM card details confidential
            Know more about Phishing scams
            Use Anti-Virus software
            Avoid Public Wi-Fi
            Check your mobile account regularly
            Report suspicious activities right away

Use a strong PIN

Always set a strong PIN code for your SIM card and never share it with anyone. A strong PIN code will make it harder for someone to gain access to your SIM card. A SIM card lock can be set from the settings app on your smartphone. The steps will vary for Android and Apple phones. You will need the default sim PIN given by your carrier to reset it. Remember, don’t enter the wrong sim PIN. It will lock your sim permanently.
Keep your SIM card details confidential

Do not share your SIM card details such as the ICCID (Integrated Circuit Card Identifier) or IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) number with anyone.
Don’t share your SIM cards with others

SIM cards are unique to each user, so don’t share your SIM cards with others, as this can compromise your personal information and security. Sharing of SIM cards can lead to sim cloning. If someone gets access to your physical SIM card, they can use a sim cloning tool or sim clone device to duplicate your sim and impersonate you. The duplicate sim can send text messages and even initiate phone calls. We will discuss sim cloning meaning and process further in the blog.
Be wary of phishing scams

Do not click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources, as they may contain malware that can compromise your SIM card security. Be educated about such scams to spot any suspicious activity immediately and take action.
Use anti-virus software

Install anti-virus software on your mobile phone to protect it from malware that can steal your SIM card details.
Avoid public Wi-Fi

Avoid using public Wi-Fi when accessing sensitive information such as your SIM card details, as public Wi-Fi networks can be easily compromised by hackers. Cybercriminals use phishing techniques with social engineering to threaten you or steal your data.
Check your mobile account regularly

Regularly monitor your mobile account for any suspicious activities or unauthorized access to your SIM card. If you receive notifications like – Sorry, we got disconnected or Account is added to a new device, do not ignore them. If you suspect that your SIM card has been hacked or cloned, contact your mobile provider immediately to report the incident and take necessary actions to protect your SIM card and personal information.
Report lost or stolen SIM cards immediately

If you lose your SIM card or it’s stolen, report it to your mobile provider immediately, so they can deactivate the SIM card and prevent its unauthorized usage.

Being aware of the types of threats your SIM card is prone to, can also help you become alert and prepared.
Different ways in which your SIM can be hijacked

SIM card hijacking, also known as SIM swapping, is a form of identity theft where someone takes control of your phone number and SIM card.

Here are some of the ways in which your SIM card can be hijacked:

            Social Engineering
            Phishing Attacks
            Sim Cloning
            Sim Jacking
            Public Wi-Fi

Keep reading to understand how these attacks are engineered and executed by cybercriminals.
Social engineering

Hackers may use social engineering techniques to trick mobile service providers into transferring your phone number and SIM card to a new device under their control. They may impersonate you or use other tactics to gain access to your personal information and account details.
Phishing attacks

Hackers may use phishing attacks to steal your personal information, such as login credentials or security questions, and use it to convince mobile service providers to transfer your phone number and SIM card to a new device.
SIM cloning

Hackers can clone your SIM card by obtaining the necessary sim cloning device (hardware) and SIM card duplicator app (software) to duplicate the SIM card. This allows them to use your phone number and SIM card on a different device.
SIM Jacking

Malware such as Trojans and spyware can be used to gain access to your phone number and SIM card details. Once installed on your device, the malware can steal your personal information and use it to hijack your SIM card. Cyber hackers usually share spyware code with you via fake promotional text. If you click on that link, the spyware will be installed on your phone and the hacker will have access to your complete phone, gradually. They can even lock you out of your own phone by changing passwords.
Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi networks can be easily compromised by hackers, who may use them to intercept your mobile traffic and steal your SIM card details.

It’s important to be vigilant and take necessary precautions to protect your SIM card from being hijacked. If you suspect that your SIM card has been hijacked, contact your mobile service provider immediately to report the incident and take necessary actions to secure your account.

While some of the SIM card hijacking attempts can be avoided by keeping strong passwords and staying alert online, sim cloning is something that needs extra understanding.
What do hackers use SIM cloning for?

SIM Cloning can be used for the following malicious activities:

            Identity Theft
            Financial Fraudulent activities
            Blackmail over sensitive information
            Cyberstalking
            Eavesdropping on your personal calls, conversations, and other activities
            Terrorism – cloned sims can be used by terrorist organizations to coordinate attacks and carry out illegal activities without getting caught.

Up till now, we have established that SIM cards can be cloned with the physical access of the SIM card. But did you know, SIM cards can also be cloned using ICCID (Integrated Circuit Card Identifier) too!

Phishing’s social engineering techniques can put that number at risk and hence your SIM card can be used for sim cloning. Read below to understand how.
Phishing and SIM card cloning

Attackers may use phishing techniques to obtain the victim’s SIM card details, such as the mobile phone number and ICCID (Integrated Circuit Card Identifier). These can be used to clone the SIM card.

For example, an attacker may send a phishing email or message to the victim, pretending to be a legitimate service provider, and ask them to provide their SIM card details for verification purposes. Once the attacker has obtained the details, they can use them to clone the SIM card and gain access to the victim’s mobile phone number and other sensitive information. However, changing a physical SIM card to an eSIM can also reduce the chances of sim cloning. Talk to your network carrier to understand more.

Therefore, it’s important to be extremely cautious when providing any sensitive information. Always verify the legitimacy of the source before sharing any personal information. It’s also recommended to use two-factor authentication, strong passwords, and anti-phishing software to protect against phishing attacks and SIM card cloning.
The common target audience for SIM Cloning

While sim cloning can happen to anyone, cybercriminals focus on certain groups for such attacks. Here is a list for your reference:

            High Profile individuals (politicians, celebrities, etc.)
            Business Owners (involved in the financial sector or any other sector with access to time-sensitive information)
            Military personnel (access to classified information)
            High net-worth individuals

Regardless of this, we urge all individuals to take the necessary steps to protect their SIM cards from hijacks or cloning. Use strong passwords, invest in good security software, and just be aware online and offline to stay protected. If you do notice any suspicious activity, reach out to your carrier immediately.

In this article, we will talk in detail on how to tell if a sim card is damaged and what can be done by you to repair a damaged sim card.
How to tell if a sim card is damaged?

Your smartphone has multiple software and hardware elements. Even the smallest of damage in these can result into poor cell phone functionality. Therefore, you need to rule out all the possibilities to check if your sim card is the one causing problems with your network.

Here are a few common symptoms that most people would have experienced with a damaged sim card.
1. Your sim card has physical damage

Now, your sim card is locked away in a protected slot in your phones. But a high fall or any external impact can damage your sim card. The damage can also occur when the sim card is not in the slot. Often users take the sim card out for cleaning purposes. If not handled carefully, sim cards can be physically damaged.

Solution:

To troubleshoot, first check if your phone’s speaker is working fine or not. If it’s a faulty speaker, you will need to fix your phone. If not, then the issue could be because of your sim card. Depending on the nature of the issue, it will either have to get fixed or replaced.
4. Frequent Pin code request

Many users set up a PIN code upon booting of their phone. If you have recently noticed that your phone shows up the Pin code request box even when your phone is not running, your sim card might be the issue. This is a clear indication that your sim card is not placed properly and is moving.

Solution:

When the sim card is not placed properly, it moves around. As soon as it finds the right position, your phone is prompted to ask the pin code because it thinks that the sim card was inserted just now.

Quick guide on how to get a duplicate sim card
March 16, 2023

Let’s face it: A mobile phone is futile without a SIM card. A phone will not allow you to perform the standard calling and texting functions. Therefore, a SIM card is crucial for the smooth functioning of a cellular device. In this article, we will walk you through the basics of a SIM card, how it works, and how it can get replicated with a clone SIM in detail below:
Buy Airtel Prepaid with exciting benefits!


Basics of SIM Cards:



SIM or Subscriber Identity Module is specifically designed to store your mobile number.


How do they work?



SIM cards are usually connected to International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), which acts as a hub for all the global cellular networks. These include the popular Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks. To say the least, a SIM card is generally a gateway to global cell communication.



Every SIM card is then identified by a unique 64-bit SIM ID. This number is usually created separately for you. It is then shared with the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) network as soon as the card is activated. After this, the phone automatically transmits your SIM card’s identifying information to the IMSI network.



Now that you know the basics of a SIM card, let’s proceed further to understand if it can be duplicated or not below:


Is it possible to duplicate a SIM card?



Yes, it is possible to duplicate a SIM card. However, it is not recommended as there is no guarantee whether two mobile phones will work properly with a cloned SIM card or not. There are chances that it may not be able to register both on the networks.



Despite these challenges, many people still go ahead with the duplication process by using SIM cloning tools, programmable cards, IMSI and KI numbers, etc.



Let us discuss the different methods of getting a clone SIM card in detail below:


Cloning SIM card using SIM cloning tool:

Here’s a secret. There are several sim cloning tools available in the market. However, choosing the best tool to clone your sim can be a tricky task.



One of the best SIM cloning tools is the MOBILedit Forensic, which allows you to extract the data, such as deleted data, call history, contacts, text messages, multimedia messages, photos, videos, recordings, calendar items, reminders, notes, data files, passwords, and data from apps such as Skype, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook, WhatsApp, Viber, Signal, WeChat and so forth in a few clicks.



Listed below are some of the important steps that will help you with this process:



    Install the software on your desktop
    Remove the SIM card from your cellular device
    Insert the card into the SIM card clone device and connect it to your desktop
    Operate the SIM card cloning tool from the main toolbar. When the window appears on your screen, be ready to duplicate the SIM card
    Select the ‘Read SIM button’ to read the content of your original SIM card. Once the data is read, choose the data which needs to be copied
    Insert the writable SIM card to enable the write SIM button
    Wait until the entire process is complete


Cloning a SIM card with Programmable Cards:

To perform this task, keep the following components mentioned below handy:

    Blank SIM programmable cards
    SIM firmware writer
    Download Woron Scan
    Targeted SIM



Once you have the above things handy, follow the steps mentioned below to know how to clone a SIM card with a programmable card:



    Download the Woron software and connect your SIM card
    Get the targeted SIM card and configure the software to clone the SIM card
    Run the IMSI search. Once the results appear, make a note of it
    Proceed with ICC search and write the code down
    Run the KI search and take off the SIM card from the device
    Install the SIM EMU software to write settings on the Blank SIM programmable cards. Insert it and locate the configuration tab, add all the details, such as KI, IMSI, and ICC, which were obtained from the Woron Scan process
    After adding the necessary data, select the ‘Write to disk’ button and name the file as SuperSIM.HEX
    Name EEPROM file as SuperSIM_EP.HEX and click on the Save button
    Install the card with a SIM card reader and add all the required files
    Finally, run the writing task to complete the cloning process


Cloning a SIM card using IMSI and Ki Number:

The IMSI code and KI (authentication key) number is an important element for SIM card cloning.



Let’s find out how to clone a SIM card using IMSI and KI numbers below:

    Turn off your phone, remove the battery, and SIM card
    Copy the IMSI number that appears on your SIM card
    Insert the card reader in the SIM card slot and connect it to your SIM and desktop.



Once the entire process is complete, your new SIM card will be cloned.



While it is pretty easy to copy your SIM card for personal reasons with the above methods, you must also remember that it is also easy for someone else to make a copy of your card. So, to avoid this, make sure to always keep your phone with you at all times.



If an unauthorized individual gets hold of it, he will most definitely clone your SIM card. So, you should consider obtaining a replacement new SIM card whenever you are not in control of your device for an extended period of time.



In a nutshell, there are also other methods contrary to the above, where you can add the same mobile number in several SIMs and benefit from having the same phone number on different devices. For instance, if you have a hands-free device with your SIM card in the car, all you have to do is clone the same number in both terminals with different SIMs and follow the steps mentioned above to clone the SIM card easily!
